# Draft Client Response â€“ Daikibo Industrials

Dear Daikibo Team,

We have completed a preliminary investigation into the suspected cybersecurity breach. Our findings indicate that:

- The suspicious activity originated from an internal private IP address (`192.168.0.101`), not from the open internet.
- This suggests that the attacker gained access via VPN credentials or compromised a device already inside the network.
- Several machines (Meiyo, Seiko, Shenzen, Berlin) were impacted by this activity.

We recommend immediate credential audits, MFA enforcement, and isolation of the affected machines. Deloitte will support you with a full forensic review and remediation plan.

Best regards,  
**Deloitte Cybersecurity Team**
