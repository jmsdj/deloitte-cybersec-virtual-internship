# Security Recommendations â€“ Deloitte Cyber Virtual Internship

To mitigate future risks, we recommend the following:

1. **Access Control**
   - Enforce VPN with MFA for all users.
   - Review user access logs regularly.
   - Disable inactive or suspicious accounts.

2. **Monitoring & Detection**
   - Deploy SIEM tools to detect anomalies in log activity.
   - Set up alerts for unusual IP requests, even within private ranges.

3. **Incident Response**
   - Create a clear escalation protocol for breaches.
   - Train employees on reporting suspicious activities.

4. **System Hardening**
   - Patch and update the dashboard system immediately.
   - Limit dashboard access to essential personnel only.

5. **Business Continuity**
   - Establish backup systems for assembly line monitoring.
   - Conduct regular tabletop exercises for cyber incident response.
