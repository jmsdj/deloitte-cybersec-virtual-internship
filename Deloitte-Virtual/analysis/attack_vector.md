# Attack Vector Analysis

## Question
Could the breach have occurred directly from the internet (without VPN access)?

## Answer
No. The IP address logged (`192.168.0.101`) is a **private IP range**, which cannot be reached directly from the internet. This indicates that the attacker either:
1. Already had VPN access, or
2. Compromised a device inside the Daikibo internal network.

## Implication
The breach was not caused by an external internet-based attack but by **internal network compromise or stolen VPN credentials**.
